  <b>Data-driven quality evaluation</b><br/>
  <span>
    Based on ISO 25010:2023, we apply a hierarchical quality evaluation methodology that relies on software metrics calculated against source code properties. Complexity, coupling, cohesion, level of proper documentation, are only some of the properties we calculate at function, class and package level.
    <br>
    Analyzing a massive, ever-changing benchmark dataset by employing AI-driven and ML-based techniques, we are able to identify the proper ranges for properties the suitable formulas to evaluate maintainability, security and their sub-characteristics.
